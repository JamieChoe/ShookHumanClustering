R code that was written for the Shook Lab at George Washington University. The aim of the project was to re-analyze the Landen Lab data set, specifically looking at day 0 (before wounding) and day 1 wounds. Cell types and gene expression patterns seen in the human data were then compared to mouse data from the Shook Lab. Lastly, a user-friendly shinycell app was created for easy downstream analysis.
